# Verbs

Verbs are words that represents an action, state, or occurence. Just like the noun, a verb may have some forms. If the changes on the noun is called _declension_, the changes on the verb is called _conjugation_. In `Altemerret`, this depends on its tense (when does it happen) and person (who does it). This language splits the person system into three, whether it is done by first person ("I" or "we"), second person ("you"), or third person ("it", "they" or so on). About the tenses, here are the tense system that is used in `Altemerret`.

- Present tense, when the action happens when the sentence is told,
- Past tense, when the action happens before the sentence is told,
- Future tense, when the action has not happened yet. In `Altemerret`, this tense is also used while denoting hypothetical events.

Here is the conjugation table of the word `olsau` (I see).

| Tense   | First person                | Second person            | Third person                      |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Present | `-au`: `olsau` (I/we see)   | `-in`: `olsin` (you see) | `-er`: `olser` (he sees/they see) |
| Past    | `-omi`: `olsomi` (I/we saw) | `-inni`: `olsinni` (...) | `-enni`: `olsenni`                |
| Future  | `-ora`: `olsora`            | `-inna`: `olsinna`       | `-erra`: `olserra`                |

Moreover, verbs can be converted into a verbal noun by the ending `-efi`; for example `olsefi` ('seeing').

## Transitivity

Some verbs are transitive, meaning that they may take an object. If there is no object on transitive verbs, the verb usually means that the action is done to "something" or to the actor itself. For example, the verb `olsau` (I see) is transitive, so it may take an object. If the object is not specified, it means that the actor sees "something". If the object is specified, it means that the actor sees the object.

Some verbs are intransitive, meaning that they may not take an object. Some of transitive verbs in English are intransitive in `Altemerret`. In which case, the can be an extra prepositional construction to denote the object. For example, the word `ankarau` (I know) is intransitive, and it needs to be followed by the preposition `ederi` (about) to translate the following sentence: `ankarer ederi enaki` - _He know a person_ (literally: _He knows about a person_).

Moreover, some prefixes may modify a verb semantically that it transforms an intransitive verb into a transitive verb. For example, the prefix `ent-` which means "_to cause to_" may be used to transform the intransitive verb `ankarau` (_I know_) into the transitive verb `entankarau` (_I make ... know_).
