# Nouns

Nouns are words that represents an object or set of objects, such as person, place, animals, phenomenon, idea, and so on. A single noun may have some forms depending on various things. This is called declension. In `Altemerret`, the declension of the nouns depends on its function within the sentence, called _case_. Here are the declension chart.

| Case name    | Ending  | Example                | Usage                                                |
| ------------ | ------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Nominative   | (none)  | `tiz` (house)          | Any other usages that is not covered by other cases. |
| Genitive     | `-zet`  | `tizzet` (of house)    | Marks an ownership or attribution to the noun.       |
| Locative     | `-nik`  | `tiznik` (at house)    | Marks a location inside, or at the noun.             |
| Allative     | `-ka`   | `tizka` (to house)     | Marks a movement towards the noun.                   |
| Ablative     | `-neri` | `tizneri` (from house) | Marks a movement away from the noun.                 |
| Instrumental | `-sim`  | `tissim` (with house)  | Marks togetherness, or the usage of a noun.          |

Moreover, nouns in `Altemerret` does not have any declension according to number. That means that singular and plural nouns are the same.

| Nom               | `ofa`    | `urt`     | `tan`     |
| Gen               | `ofazet` | `urtzet`  | `tanzet`  |
